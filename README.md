# iOS-ObjC-Swift-CABasicAnimation-Shaking-Effect

This repo is to show you guys how to use CABasicAnimation to do the shaking animation, (which is pretty commonly used in the scenario of user typing in a wrong password into a textfield)

Codes available for both Objective-C as well as Swift.

## Note:
This repo is part of my video tutorial of how to make easy animation in iOS with Lottie and CABasicAnimation. Full tutorial is here in Youtube: https://youtu.be/4uBJQyu8xXY.
